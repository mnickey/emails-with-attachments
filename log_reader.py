REQUEST:
On a Host that is connected to a LAN, you have a log-file that contains a list of users who have
logged onto some of the machines on the network,
in the past 24 hrs. Write a script that searches for computers on the network that are currently online,
and then sends a text-file to appropriate users on the online computers.
At the end of the run, the script should mark in the log file, computers to which the file has been transmitted.
In the log file, it should also add computers that have been discovered in the current traversal,
which were not listed originally.

Please specify any assumptions you make and explain how youâ€™d test your code.

Assumptions:
The log file is in csv form.
The log file contains
	a date/time stamp
	username
	user-email address
	computer-id
	online status (online vs offline)
	script will be in the same directory as the logfile or the logfile will be copied to the same directory
